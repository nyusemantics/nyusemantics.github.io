      <h1>How to Ignore Counterexamples: Homogeneity Across Times and Worlds
 </h1>
      <h2>Omar Agha, New York University</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      In this talk, I present three case studies in which I apply the theory of homogeneity and non-maximality to problem areas other than plural definites: conditionals, temporal expressions, and weak necessity modals. In each case, I give an explicit formal description of what it would mean to treat such objects as plural predication structures, and I give novel arguments in favor of the plural referential analysis. I also discuss some novel data involving plural definites and adverbs under focus-sensitive operators like <i>only</i> and <i>even</i>, and I suggest an amendment to the theory of non-maximality that can capture the new data.
