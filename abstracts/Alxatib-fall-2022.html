      <h1> Two <i>until</i>s in English?
 </h1>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">

Some believe that there are two <i>until</i>s in English: one durative and apparently polarity-insensitive (1); and one punctual and requires a (local) licensing negation (2).

<ol>
<li><ol type="a">
<li>Kim was asleep until 6. </li>
<li>Kim was not asleep until 6. </li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><ol type="a">
<li>*Kim woke up until 6. </li>
<li>Kim didn't wake up until 6. </li>
</ol>
  </li>
</ol>
      

<p>
Advocates of this view (e.g. Karttunen (1974) and many others), have claimed that an alternative single-entry view would have to explain not only the distributional heterogeneity observed in (1,2), but also a number of differences in the inferences that are licensed by durative uses of <i>until</i> and by its punctual uses. In this talk I review some of the observations that have guided this debate, and examine Iatridou and Zeijlstra's (2021) recent unifying proposal.
