      <h1>Possible worlds in Children's Counterfactual Judgments

</h1>
      <h2>Ioana Grosu, NYU</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Past studies on children’s counterfactual reasoning have been mainly centered around the two following questions: (1) Can children reason counterfactually? (2) At what age does counterfactual reasoning arise? (Rafetseder et al 2013, Nyhout and Ganea 2019)
</p><p>
In the present study, I explore another aspect of counterfactual reasoning – <i>When children reason counterfactually, what is the nature of the changes they allow from the actual world?</i> To answer this question, I propose a novel experimental study, which utilizes a causal-networks based take on Lewis’s similarity principle, and analyze children’s responses to three counterfactual scenarios. I compare children’s responses to these three scenarios to responses from an adult norming sample, and show that when children’s responses deviate from those of adults, they demonstrate a fairly consistent strategy in their choice of counterfactual worlds.
</p><p>
Within the causal models approach, following Hiddleston (2005) and Pearl (2009), similarity to the actual world is determined by the maintenance of non-antecedent, causally independent facts within a given scenario. In addition, mature counterfactual reasoning requires maintenance of the laws of a given scenario. It is therefore possible that when children’s responses are non-adult-like, children demonstrate flexibility in terms of changes to non-antecedent facts, or flexibility in the maintenance of the laws of a scenario. In the current study, I provide evidence that the former is the case, and argue that children’s non-adult-like responses are due to a lack of a parsimonious approach in their treatment of facts.
