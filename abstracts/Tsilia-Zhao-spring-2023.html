      <h1>What the <i>then</i>-present puzzle tells us about perspectives in tense
 </h1>
      <h2>Anastasia Tsilia, MIT and Zhuoye Zhao, NYU</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
        In this talk, we focus on the <i>then</i>-present puzzle, namely the observation that the present tense is incompatible with the temporal adverbial ‘<i>then</i>’ 
        (Ogihara & Sharvit 2012; Vostrikova 2018; Tsilia 2021). This is not only the case in root clauses when ‘<i>then</i>’ picks out a time overlapping with the 
        speech time (e.g. *John is then not feeling well), but even more interestingly in embedded clauses too when the present tense is shifted 
        (e.g. In Greek: Yanis thought that Mary is pregnant (*then)). The phenomenon is cross-linguistically robust, observed so far in Russian, Modern Hebrew, 
        Modern Greek and Japanese, all languages where the shifted present does not have to co-occur with the time of the utterance but can simply overlap with 
        the time of the attitude. We further investigate the behaviour of ‘<i>then</i>’ in past-under-past sentences, when we have an embedded past tense instead of a 
        shifted present. It turns out that ‘<i>then</i>’ is acceptable with an embedded past, even when the latter is deleted and should in principle give rise to the 
        same truth conditions are a shifted/relative present. Modern Greek is a case in point, since being a mixed tense language, it has both a shifted present 
        and a deleted past, and yet ‘<i>then</i>’ is only compatible with the latter.  Where does this incompatibility come from? We propose an analysis in which 
        (i) non-deleted, interpreted  tenses (present or past) as well as ‘<i>then</i>’ are sensitive to the local perspective, and (ii) deleted/zero tenses are
        non-perspectival bound variables. We account for the puzzle thanks to the perspectival conditions of present and ‘<i>then</i>’, which prevent them from 
        designating overlapping times. The contrast between shifted/relative present and deleted past is captured by their perspectival sensitivity and 
        non-sensitivity respectively. In other words, we show that a shifted present is not fully identical to a deleted past, since the former is perspective 
        sensitive. Time permitting, we will discuss some immediate challenges to this account as well as some answers to those.
