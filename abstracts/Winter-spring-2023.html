      <h1>Countability and measurement in comparatives
 </h1>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      The mass-count distinction can strongly affect meanings of nominal comparatives: ‘more
stones/fruits/packs’ trigger counting; ‘more stone/fruit/sugar’ trigger measuring. This simple pattern
often breaks down. One such case is counting in comparatives with mass nouns like ‘furniture’,
‘baggage’ and ‘weaponry’. Another is measuring with count nouns in mass-count comparatives like
‘more gold than diamonds’ and ‘more friends than money’. We report new results indicating that
counting in comparatives is primed by both perceived discreteness and a grammatical ‘count’ status,
but neither of these factors forces it. In cases of mismatch between grammar and perception, last
resort operations come into play. This provides a unified picture on the grammatical, lexical and
semantic-pragmatic effects on discrete and non-discrete meanings.
