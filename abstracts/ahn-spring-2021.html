      <h1>The D-2 Theory: A competition-based account of definite expressions </h1>
      <h2>Dorothy Ahn, Rutgers</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
Natural language data suggest that expressions such as pronouns, definite descriptions, and demonstratives across languages interact with each other in ways that affect their distribution and possible interpretation. Building on different approaches to definite expressions such as Roberts 2003 and Elbourne 2005, I propose a unified semantic account of anaphoric expressions where they share the same underlying semantic structure and only differ in the amount of restrictions they carry. I discuss theoretical and empirical motivations for such an account, focusing on a phenomenon in bare argument languages where the presence of pronouns block the use of bare nouns in anaphoric contexts. The main advantages of this theory include a) allowing independently motivated economy principles such as Minimize Restrictors! (Schlenker 2005) to apply directly to account for competition, b) systematically predicting gradience and variation in the data, and c) applying uniformly across languages without lexically specified denotations. I also discuss the implications the account has on the semantic analysis of pointing that is used to refer to entities in sign languages. </p>
