      <h1>Non-canonical uses of <i>some</i></h1>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
          The English determiner <i>some</i> is used to express indifference or ignorance as to the particular individual that satisfies some claim, as in the examples in (1). Examples such as these form the core use cases of <i>some</i>.
      </p>
      <p class="view">
          (1)   a.  I’ve been stung by some wasp.
          <br>
                b.  Some professor is dancing on the table, but I don’t know who.
      </p>
      <p class="view">
          However, <i>some</i> can be used in other ways as well. In this talk, I examine two additional uses, what I call the numeral modifier <i>some</i> and exclamative-<i>some</i>, as in the examples in (2) and (3).
      </p>
      <p class="view">
          (2)   There were twenty-some people at the party.
          <br>
          (3)   a.  She is some dancer!
          <br>
                b.  Some lawyer he is!
      </p>
      <p class="view">
          Paralleling the canonical cases of <i>some</i>, the numerical modifier <i>some</i> also commits the speaker to being in a state of ignorance or indifference, in particular about which number satisfies a claim. On the other hand, <i>some</i>-exclamatives express surprise or amazement that the subject of the exclamative holds the property denoted by the NP complement of <i>some</i>. I use tools from Alternative Semantics to provide analyses of the non-canonical cases in (2) and (3), and argue that <i>some</i> has a common core across its varied uses.
