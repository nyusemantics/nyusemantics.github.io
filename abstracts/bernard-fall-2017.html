      <h1>A Montagovian semantics for discourse connectives</h1>
      <h2>Timothée Bernard, Université Paris Diderot</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
          Using tools from continuation semantics, we present a Montagovian treatment of the anaphoric character of discourse connectives (<i>so</i>, <i>instead</i>, etc.). Considering discourse arguments as event-like objects from the Davidsonian tradition allows us to naturally extend previous accounts of pronominal anaphora to adverbial connectives (1). The same set of ideas can be used to formally model the observation that causal subordinate connectives (e.g. <i>because</i>) restrict the interpretation of verbs of report to an intensional use (2) while contrastive ones (e.g. <i>although</i>) are compatible with both intensional (3.a) and evidential (3.b) interpretations.
