Thanks for having me back to Semantics Group! Hopefully this isn't too boring for everybody, but I'd like to take this homecoming as an opportunity to revisit a few issues concerning superlatives that outscoped my dissertation. In the crosshairs will be interactions between with modals on the one hand, and negative polarity items on the other. I'll suggest that the data appear to pull in two different analytical directions, toward scope and degrees in the first case, but toward locality and individuals in the second. I will then try and cut a dynamic path forward. </p>
