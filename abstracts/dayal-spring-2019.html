      <h1>The Fine Structure of the Interrogative Left Periphery</h1>
      <h2>Veneeta Dayal (Yale)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
In this talk I explore the possibility that there are three points on the left periphery where
interrogative meaning is built up, CP<sub>+WH</sub>, Force-P<sub>+Q</sub>, SAP<sub>ASK</sub>:
</p><p>
[<sub>SAP</sub> SA<sup>0</sup>
<sub>ASK</sub> [<sub>Force-P</sub> Force<sup>0</sup>
<sub>+Q</sub> [<sub>CP</sub> C
<sup>0</sup>
<sub>+WH</sub> [TP]]]]
</p><p>
At CP, the +WH specification takes the TP denotation and creates a set of propositions, the
semantic type for questions. At SAP, the question is anchored to the context of utterance via
speaker and addressee co-ordinates. CPs are canonically what we find in complement positions,
SAPs what we find in matrix questions and quotations. This two-way distinction, I would
venture to say, is relatively uncontroversial or at least less radical sounding than the postulation
of a three-way distinction.
</p><p>
I argue for a third structural position, in between CP and SAP, with a distinct semantic profile. I
call this position Force-P<sub>+Q</sub>. While the term Force-P is familiar from Rizzi (1997), the
characterization of this position is likely different from what has so far been assumed in the
literature. I argue that Force<sup>0</sup>
<sub>+Q</sub> takes a set of propositions (a question denotation) and turns it
into a centered question, a question that is crucially active for someone. This allows Force-P to
either feed into SAP, and be linked to a contextually provided anchor, or enter into a
complementation relation with a predicate and be linked to an argument of that predicate.
</p><p>
The empirical justification for the three-way distinction in interrogative syntax-semantics comes
from the following inter-related phenomena, which will be discussed in some detail in the course
of the talk: embedding predicates, subject-aux inversion, biased questions, (polar) question
particles, intonational contours, alternative vs. polar questions. In doing so, I draw on earlier
collaborative work with Jane Grimshaw (Dayal and Grimshaw 2009) and Rajesh Bhatt (Bhatt
and Dayal 2014 and subsequent versions), while absolving them of all responsibility for anything
in this proposal that they may not have signed on to.      </p>
