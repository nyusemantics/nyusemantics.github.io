      <h1>Question-Answer Clauses: relation to focus

</h1>
      <h2>Aurore Gonzalez, Harvard</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In American Sign Language (ASL), a construction is found that consists of two parts: a Q-constituent conveying a question and a A-constituent conveying an answer to that question (1). This construction has been called a Question-Answer Clause (QAC)  (Caponigro & Davidson 2011). In contrast to a question-answer pair in dialogue, a QAC requires the same person to produce it.

(1) [<sub>Q-constituent</sub> <span style="text-decoration: overline">IX LIKE SALAD</span><sup>brow-raise</sup>], [<sub>A-constituent</sub><span style="text-decoration: overline">NO</span><sup>headshake</sup>HATE]
</p><p>
While QACs have been argued to be question-answer pairs at the discourse-level (Hoza et al. 1997), I show that polar QACs are embedded question-answer pairs (Caponigro & Davidson 2011). I then explore the hypothesis that QACs are used to express contrastive focus and shows how this can account for the answering of QACs.
