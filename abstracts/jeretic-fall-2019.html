      <h1>Strengthening and scalemate association in the modal domain

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">

There is cross-linguistic and language-specific evidence that functional root modals like <em>can</em> and <em>must</em> are merged below sentential negation in the syntax. However, in many cases, root modals have a wide scope interpretation. Curiously, only necessity modals do (a generalization made from a significant set of languages from different families, cf. de Haan 1997, Iatridou & Zeijlstra 2013). Below are a few examples of these wides scope readings.

<p> (1) a. You <b>must</b> <em>not</em> go. (translation for b-c-d) <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. Il <em>ne</em> <b>faut</b> <em>pas</em> y aller. [French] <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c. Tu <em>ne</em> <b>dois</b> <em>pas</em> y aller. (ambiguous with "you don't have to go") [French] <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d.  <em>No</em> <b>debes</b> ir. [Spanish] </p>

<p> I propose a novel analysis for these interpretations, giving arguments from the interaction of negation and French necessity modals <em>falloir</em> (1b) and <em>devoir</em> (1c). </p>

<p> Namely, I argue that the wide scope interpretation of <em>falloir</em> and <em>devoir</em> is not achieved by raising above negation (as argued in Homer 2011, Iatridou & Zeijlstra 2013), but by leaving the modal in situ, and strengthening the negated necessity expression to the equivalent of a wide scope reading of the modal. </p>

<p> I assimilate this analysis with other accounts of strengthening of connectives and quantifiers cross-linguistically (Bowler 2014, Bassi & Bar-Lev 2016, Singh et al 2016), that are the result of a grammaticalized implicature (à la Fox 2007) of an expression containing a lexical item that lacks a stronger lexicalized scalemate. I give independent arguments for <em>falloir</em> lacking a weaker scalemate (i.e. a possibility modal), which results in strengthening in the presence of negation. I also argue that <em>devoir</em> optionally associates with a scalemate. </p>

<p> Finally, I discuss how the strengthening analysis provides a hypothesis for the typological asymmetry between root necessity and possibility modals in their interaction with negation, as long as they have to stay in situ: the wide scope necessity reading is a result of strengthening the weak &#172;&#9633; expression, while the wide scope possibility reading is underivable by strengthening, since &#172;&#9671; is already strong. </p>
