      <h1>The Statistical, the Prescriptive, and the Undifferentiated.</h1>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>Some linguistic expressions are used to express statistical claims (e.g., quantificational adverbs like <i>usually</i>), while others are used to express prescriptive claims (e.g., deontic modals like <i>should</i>). Strikingly, however, a series of recent studies indicate that people's use of certain expressions is actually governed by a mix of the statistical and very prescriptive. This same basic result has been obtained in research on a number of very different sorts of linguistic expressions: impersonal pronouns, generics, gradable adjectives, and root modals. I will be discussing research on all four of these types of expressions, and on an attempt to understand why people's use of all of them involved this same statistical/prescriptive mixture.
