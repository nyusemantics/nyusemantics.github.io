      <h1>Plurality and dependency: the view from sign language</h1>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
          Over the last 20 years, empirical puzzles involving plurals have motivated changes to our understanding of semantic composition in natural language. In this talk, I address these topics with new data from two sign languages &mdash; LSF and ASL &mdash; focusing on the use of space and iconicity. In the verbal domain, I show that pluractional verb meanings display 'scopable iconicity,' in which an iconic meaning can be evaluated at different structural positions. In the nominal domain, I show that dependent indefinites and the adjectives <i>same</i> and <i>different</i> show spatial agreement with a plural licensor. Both of these findings inform existing theoretical debates about the semantics of plurality and dependency.
