      <h1>Reference to dependencies in multiple-wh questions

This paper probes cross-sentential anaphora to dependencies in multiple-wh questions. Intuitively, a multiple-wh question establishes a dependency between wh-expressions when it admits a pair-list answer. Given a model involving a set of boys and a set of gifts, the multiple-wh question in (1) is seeking to identify the proper pairing between these two sets. In other words, this question presupposes that there is a dependency between the boys and the gifts: for each boy, there is a gift such that he bought it. </p>

<p> (1) Which boy bought which gift? <br>
      
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Answer: Bob bought the Thomas train, Tim the Brio train, and Sam the Lego train. </p>

<p> This dependency-seeking question can support cross-sentential anaphora. For example, in (2), the plural pronoun refers to all the boys ranged over by the wh-expression <i>which boy</i>, while the singular pronoun is evaluated relative to the value of <i>them</i>: for each boy in the set retrieved by <i>them</i>, <i>it</i> is understood to be the gift that he bought. </p>

<p> (2) Which boy bought which gift and who did each of them send it to? <br>
      
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Answer: Bob bought the Thomas train, Tim the Brio train, and Sam the Lego train. They all sent the gifts to their sisters. </p>
        
<p> In addition, the dependency is also accessible to the singular pronouns in (3). Unlike (2), (3) does not involve distributivity. The value of <i>he</i> varies from boy to boy, and correspondingly, <i>it</i> is interpreted relative to different boys, i.e., for each boy, <i>it</i> refers to the gift that he bought. </p>

<p> (3) Which boy bought which gift and who did he send it to? <br>
      
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Answer: Bob bought the Thomas train and sent it to Ada; Tim bought the Brio train and sent it to Dora, and Sam bought the Lego train and sent it to Eva. </p>

<p> In this paper, I propose that these two kinds of reference to dependencies in multiple-wh questions result from two different mechanisms. The pattern illustrated by (2) is analogous to the phenomenon known as quantificational subordination (Karttunen 1969; van den Berg 1996; Brasoveanu 2010). The pattern illustrated by (3) is a natural result of conjoining a multiple-wh question with another question. </p>
