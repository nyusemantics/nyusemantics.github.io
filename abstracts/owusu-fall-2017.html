      <h1>Actuality Entailment in Akan</h1>
      <h2>Augustina Owusu, Rutgers</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
          The Akan modal <i>tumi</i> always has an actuality entailment when it is used as an ability modal. The data shows that this interpretation is not dependent on the type of aspect that scopes over the modal. My analysis is based on Francez and Bagliniâ€™s (2015) <b>causal entailment</b> theory for <i>manage</i>. I argue that the Akan ability modal <i>tumi</i> has three components; a modal assertion, a presupposition of a familiar catalyst which is a causally necessary but causally insufficient condition for the truth of q (the prejacent) and a presupposition that the speaker has reliable evidence for the actual occurrence of the event. I will argue that it is the evidence presupposition that generates an actuality entailment when the modal is used.
