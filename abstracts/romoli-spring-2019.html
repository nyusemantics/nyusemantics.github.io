      <h1>Homogeneity or implicature: an experimental approach 
 </h1>
      <h2>Jacopo Romoli, Ulster (based on joint work with Lyn Tieu and Cory Bill)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
A sentence containing disjunction in the scope of a possibility modal, such as (1a), gives rise to the free choice inference in (1b). This inference presents a well-known puzzle in light of standard treatments of modals and disjunction (Kamp 1974 and much subsequent work). To complicate things further, free choice tends to disappear under negation: (2a) doesnâ€™t merely convey the negation of (1a), but rather the stronger dual prohibition reading in (2b). There are two main approaches to the free choice-dual prohibition pattern in the literature, based on implicature and homogeneity. We present experimental findings that favour the homogeneity approach, and further discuss how the implicature approach could be developed to account for the results. </p>
