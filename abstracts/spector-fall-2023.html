      <h1>Reasoning with Quantifiers, Lewisian Imaging and the Confirmation Paradox

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
        From a normative point of view, the conclusions we can draw from a sentence of the form <i>No A is B</i> are the same as the ones we can draw from <i>No B is A</i>, because <i>No</i> is a symmetric determiner, and therefore these two sentence types are logically equivalent. I will present experimental evidence (based on joint work with Vincent Mouly) showing that people do not in fact reason in the same way with No A is B and with No B is A. In particular, people's estimate of the number of As after processing <i>No A is B</i> is higher than after processing <i>No B is A</i> (and vice-versa for B). I will argue that this instantiates a more general property of restrictors: we tend not to revise our beliefs about the size of the restrictor set even when receiving information that would in fact warrant such a revision. I will argue that this effect can be explained if we make the following hypotheses: <br>

        - Belief update does not (always) correspond to probabilistic conditionalization, but can also proceed by <i>Imaging</i>, as defined by David Lewis (1976). In a nutshell, when revising our beliefs with a proposition S, our posterior degree of confidence in a certain proposition T corresponds to our prior degree of confidence in the conditional 'If S, T' (using Stalnaker's semantics for conditionals), rather than to the conditional probability P(T|S). <br>
        - Restrictors tend to serve as <i>anchors</i> when we engage in conditional reasoning: when considering the different ways in which  a quantified sentence could be true, we mentally keep constant the restrictor set. I will relate this both to the possibility of de re readings for restrictors and to recent experimental results about verification strategies for quantified statements (Knowlton, Pietroski, Williams et al. 2023). <br>
        
        I will show that how these findings and the proposed theory can shed light on the <i>confirmation paradox </i>(see also Rinard 2014): given a statement S of the form 'All As are Bs', people are more prone to think that an observation of an object that has both properties A and B 'confirms' S than they are to think that observing an object that is both not-B and not-A confirms S, and I will discuss, time permitting, further experimental results (based on joint work with Nicolas Poisson) pertaining to the confirmation paradox.
