      <h1>Pair-list readings in Inquisitive Semantics</h1>
      <h2>Thom van Gessel, ILLC
</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3> Pair-list readings of questions like "Which book did every student read?" seem to be cases of inverse scope. But on the standard view, quantifiers cannot simply take scope over questions. Inquisitive Semantics solves this issue by analyzing questions and statements as objects of the same type.  A problem for this approach is that it may generate pair-list readings in cases where they do not seem available. I will discuss this challenge based on experimental results and suggest ways in which we can deal with this.
