      <h1>Discourse dynamics of weak definites

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">

        We present new empirical observations with respect to the referential properties and discourse dynamics of weak definite noun phrases in German, such as <i>zum Arzt gehen</i> ‘go to the doctor’. We argue that weak definites are less discourse prominent than regular indefinite and definite descriptions and that this is mirrored in a weaker anaphoric potential for the weak definites than for indefinites and regular definites. To support this claim we present data from two production studies that show that weak readings are influenced by (i) the (non-)stereotypicality of the described situation, (ii) the morphological marking of the noun phrase, and (iii) an explicit sentence that sets a frame.
