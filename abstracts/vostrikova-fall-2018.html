      <h1>Phrasal and Clausal Exceptive-Additive Constructions Crosslinguistically</h1>
      <h2>Katia Vostrikova, UMass</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>In this talk I will present my dissertation project. In this work I make an observation that in many
different languages a word that means <i>except</i> in some contexts, in other contexts gets the reverse
meaning and means <i>in addition to</i>. The ambiguity of this sort exists in Russian, Turkish, Hindi,
Bulgarian, Persian, English and other languages. This ambiguity can be illustrated by the pair of
English examples in (1) and (2).</p><p>
(1) Every girl besides Anna came (the inference: Anna is a girl who did not come)<br>
(2) Some girl besides Anna came (the inference: Anna is a girl who came)</p><p>
The meaning this expression gets depends on the other functional elements in a sentence and not
on the global context where the sentence is pronounced. In each context only one of the
meanings is available. This ambiguity is not predicted by the existing theories of exceptives. I
also add novel observations supporting the claim that the syntactic structure the standard
semantic theory of exceptives assumes is incorrect. The crosslinguistic study shows that in many
languages what follows the word <i>except</i> is not a DP, but is a reduced clause. This fact is
challenging for the existing theories because they capture the meaning contribution of exceptives
by assuming that they can directly restrict domains of quantifiers such as ‘every girl’. However,
clauses do not have the correct semantic type to do this job. I show that in some languages the
exceptive-additive ambiguity extends to clausal cases.
In this talk I will mainly focus on deriving the ambiguity for phrasal cases. I will present a
formal theory that derives the ambiguity via scopal interaction between two elements, one of
which is negation. The story I develop accounts for the inferences coming with each of the
readings and for their distribution. In principle the exceptive and the additive reading are
generated in all cases, but one of them is always either contradictory or tautological, thus is ill
formed.
