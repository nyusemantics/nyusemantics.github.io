      <h1><i>Just</i> refuses to answer the QUD </h1>
      <h2>Alex Warstadt, NYU</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
         This talk presents a novel analysis of the discourse particle <i>just</i>. In popular models of discourse, the conversational moves available to a speaker are narrowly constrained by questions under discussion. I propose that <i>just</i> lends a degree of freedom to speakers by providing a mechanism to abstain from addressing QUD. Abstention is formalized as Cohen and Krifka’s (2014) <i>denegation</i> operator which is a generalization of dynamic negation to the speech act domain. Empirical results include an account of Wiegand’s (2016) observation that <i>just</i> rescues trivial answers to questions (1), and a discussion of the role of <i>just</i> in several naturally occurring discourses.
