      <h1>Covert reciprocals: a syntactic account of reciprocal alternations </h1>
      <h2>Jad Wehbe (MIT) </h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
        Certain predicates like &ldquo;hug&rdquo; require an overt object when the subject is singular (1a), while being able to surface without an overt object when the subject denotes a plurality (1b). These alternations have been referred to as reciprocal alternations (Levin, 1993; Winter, 2019), and indeed it is tempting to paraphrase the 1-place variant in (1b) with a reciprocal object as in (1c). A straightforward account of this alternation would be to propose that (1b) has a covert reciprocal in object position (Hackl, 2000). A major challenge for this syntactic approach is that the 1-place variant and the overt reciprocal are not always truth-conditionally equivalent. For example, in the context in (2), (1c) is true while (1b) isn&rsquo;t.<br>
        <br>
        (1) a. Jane hugged Mary.<br>
         b. Jane and Mary hugged.<br>
         c. Jane and Mary hugged each other.<br>
        <br>
        (2) Context: Jane hugged Mary while Mary was sleeping and then Jane fell asleep and Mary woke up and hugged her.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The goal of this talk will be to (i) propose a covert reciprocal analysis that can account for the truth-conditional differences between overt and covert reciprocals and (ii) provide evidence for a covert reciprocal account and against an alternative lexical account that treats &ldquo;hug&rdquo; in (1a) as a 1-place collective predicate (e.g. Winter, 2019). I assume a decompositional analysis of reciprocals, following Heim et al. (1991) and argue that the differences in truth-conditions can be accounted for if we assume that the reciprocal has to be bound as low as possible when it is elided. I provide evidence for my account by arguing that covert reciprocals, just like their overt counterparts, exhibit characteristic properties of non-collective plural predication, as expected by the decompositional approach. Namely, I show that covert reciprocals give rise to homogeneity, non-maximality and cumulative readings, even when the subject denotes an individual of cardinality 2, as in (1b). I argue that these patterns are not predicted by a lexical account that treats hug in (1a) as a collective predicate which directly takes the plurality denoted by &ldquo;Jane and Mary&rdquo; as an argument.<br>
