      <h1>Representing Thematic Relations: Reconciling Neuroimaging Data with Formal Semantic Theory (Data Discussion) </h1>
      <h2>Adina Williams, NYU</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
          I'd like to have an informal data discussion where I present some neurolinguistic findings from two experiments in my dissertation, and speculate about their potential ramifications for formal semantic theories of argument structure. The two experiments address whether neural representations of adicity/valence interact with neural representations of events and plurality. I will present several linking hypotheses concerning how certain denotations might translate into the brain responses I observe. These linking hypotheses incorporate Neo-Davidsonian event semantics and processing economy constraints.
