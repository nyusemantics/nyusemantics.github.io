      <h1>The collective-distributive ambiguity &mdash; a view from the corpus</h1>
      <h2>Kata Wohlmuth (Pompeu Fabra)</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">
      Most sentences with a plural subject and an indefinite object are ambiguous between the collective and the distributive interpretations: 'The boys lifted a piano' can mean either that the boys lifted a piano together, or the boys lifted a piano each. Assuming that this ambiguity gets resolved once such sentences appear in context brings up the question of what linguistic factors play a role in the disambiguation. In this talk I will give possible answers to this question based on data extracted from the Prenn Treebank and the GloWBe corpus.
