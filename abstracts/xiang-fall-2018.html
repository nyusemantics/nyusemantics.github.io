      <h1>A hybrid categorial approach of question composition</h1>
      <h2>Yimei Xiang, Rutgers</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>This talk revisits two fundamental issues in question semantics â€” what does a question mean, and how is this meaning compositionally derived? Drawn on observations with the distribution of <i>wh</i>-words in questions and free relatives as well as quantificational variability effects in question embeddings, I argue that the nominal meanings of short answers must be derivable from question denotations, which therefore calls for a categorial approach to define questions. I provide a novel hybrid categorial approach to compose questions. This approach overcomes the problems with traditional categorial approaches in defining bare <i>wh</i>-indefinites, composing multi-<i>wh</i>-questions, and coordinating questions.
