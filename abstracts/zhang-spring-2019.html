      <h1>Split semantics for non-monotonic quantifiers in <i>than</i>-clauses
</h1>
      <h2>Linmin Zhang, NYU Shanghai</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Comparatives containing non-monotonic quantifiers within <i>than</i>-clauses pose non-trivial challenges for compositional semantics (e.g., <i>Balloon A is higher than <b>exactly two</b> of the others are</i>, see, e.g., Schwarzschild 2008). Following Bumford (2017a)â€™s split treatment for definiteness (see also Brasoveanu 2013), this paper argues for a two-stage  semantic derivation for these comparatives: a bottom-up (from local to global) composition followed by a delayed top-down (from global to local) evaluation. More specifically, I propose that the semantic contribution of both these embedded non-monotonic quantifiers and the embedding morpheme <i>than</i> is twofold: first, they each introduce  a discourse referent (i.e., some individual or degree-related value) during the stage of  bottom-up composition; then, they simultaneously impose tests of maximality (and  cardinality) during the stage of top-down evaluation. The current account further  suggests that basically, the semantics of comparatives is similar to that of cumulative-reading sentences (e.g., <i>exactly three boys saw exactly five movies</i>), both involving simultaneous restrictions but no scope-taking among cardinalities or degree-related values. I show that this has profound implications for theories of comparatives.
