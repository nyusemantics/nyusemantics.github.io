      <h1>The presupposition of <i>even</i>
 </h1>
      <h2>Klaus von Heusinger, University of Cologne</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="view">

        Here I present a new observation with regard to the felicity of using <i>even</i>. For an <i>even</i>-sentence like <i>even Mary came</i> (with <i>Mary</i> bearing the focus here), it cannot be used to answer a question like <i>who came</i> or <i>who was unlikely to come</i>. Instead, the felicitous use of <i>even Mary came</i> is to (implicitly or explicitly) address issues like "how successful was the party", "how enthusiastic were people", "how urgent was the matter", etc. Thus I propose that the use of even is QUD-sensitive, always with regard to a contextually salient degree question. <i>Even</i> brings a degree-based presupposition of additivity, not an entity-based one (see also Greenberg 2018 for a similar view).  An even-sentence indicates a degree increased from a contextual threshold in addressing a degree question (e.g., <i>even Mary came</i> is interpreted as "the talk was really  popular, to the extent that Mary came" under a relevant scenario).
