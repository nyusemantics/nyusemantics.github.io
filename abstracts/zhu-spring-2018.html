      <h1><i>Already</i>, just scalarity</h1>
      <h2>Hanzhi Zhu, MIT</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div>The particles&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>already</em>&nbsp;are commonly thought of and analyzed as particles that mirror the other (L&ouml;bner 1989, Krifka 2000, Ippolito 2007, inter alia).&nbsp; The particle&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;has been robustly argued to have an additive presupposition in the same vein as particles like&nbsp;<em>too</em>.&nbsp; However, I argue that a dual semantics for&nbsp;<em>already</em>, as all previous accounts attempt to implement, is untenable, motivated by asymmetries between the two particles such as in the following pair of examples:</div>
<div>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>You wake up after a full night of sleep, estimating that it's 9am. You check your clock.</em></div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#Wow, it's still 7am!</div>
<div>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>You wake up after a full night of sleep, estimating that it's 7am. You check your clock.</em></div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wow, it's already 9am!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Instead, I propose that&nbsp;<em>already</em>&nbsp;has no additive presupposition but instead an&nbsp;<em>even</em>-style scalar 'likelihood' presupposition enriched with an exhaustivity operator.&nbsp; Such an analysis offers empirical improvements over previous analyses, notably in its ability to directly capture the earlier-than-expected inference conveyed by&nbsp;<em>already</em>.</div>
